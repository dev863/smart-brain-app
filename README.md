#Smart Brain App
This app allows the user to register if the user in new to the app or it allows the users to login with username and password.
User can enter any url of an image , the app detects the face in the image.
The number of entries made by the user is displayed along with the name of the user.
Users data is stored in a database.


I've used React for front end , Node.js for backend and Postgre SQL for the database.
For face recognition I've used clarifai's machine learning api.
